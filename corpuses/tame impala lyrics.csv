2165830,Tame Impala,The Less I Know the Better,"Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, ""Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather""
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better
Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise, when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh, my love, can't you see that you're on my mind?
Don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye
She said, ""It's not now or never
Wait ten years, we'll be together""
I said, ""Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever""
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever

I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
I was doing fine without ya
'Til I saw your face, now I can't erase
Givin' in to all his bullshit
Is this what you want? Is this who you are?
I was doing fine without ya
'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine
Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you
Said, ""Come on, Superman, say your stupid line""
Said, ""Come on, Superman, say your stupid line""
Said, ""Come on, Superman, say your stupid line"""
2165813,Tame Impala,"New Person, Same Old Mistakes","I can just hear them now
""How could you let us down?""
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way 'round
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one, every trait
I tried, but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
Will I be in too deep?
Going with what I always longed for
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
Well, I don't care, I'm in love
Stop before it's too late
I know…
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
I finally know what it's like
(You don't have what it takes)
Stop before it's too late
I know there's too much at stake
Making the same mistakes
And I still don't know why it's happening
Stop while it's not too late
And I still don't know…

Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
The point is, I have the right
Not thinkin' in black and white
Thinkin' it's worth the fight
Soon I'll be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
Well, I don't care, I'm in love
Stop before it's too late
Feel like a brand-new person
But you'll make the same old mistakes
So how do I know I've gone too far?
(You don't have what it takes)
Stop before it's too late
Man, I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
Man, I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
Feel like a brand-new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
Stop thinking that the only option was…
Feel like a brand-new person
I finally know what it's like
Stop thinking that the only option was…
In a new direction
So how will I know I've gone too far?
Stop thinking that the only option was…
And I know it's hard to describe
Stop thinking that the only option was…
So how will I know that it's right?"
721026,Tame Impala,Let It Happen,"It's always around me, all this noise
But not nearly as loud as the voice saying
""Let it happen, let it happen (It's gonna feel so good)
Just let it happen, let it happen""
All this running around trying to cover my shadow
A notion growing inside, now all the others seem shallow
All this running around bearing down on my shoulders
I can hear an alarm, must be morning
I heard about a whirlwind that's coming 'round
It's gonna carry off all that isn't bound
And when it happens, when it happens (I won't be holding on)
So let it happen, let it happen
All this running around, I can't fight it much longer
Something's trying to get out and it's never been closer
If my take-off fails, make up some other story
But if I never come back, tell my mother I'm sorry

2165828,Tame Impala,Yes I’m Changing,"I was raging, it was late
In the world my demons cultivate
I felt the strangest emotion but it wasn't hate for once
Yes, I'm changing, yes, I'm gone
Yes, I'm older, yes, I'm moving on
And if you don't think it's a crime, you can come along with me
Life is moving, can't you see?
There's no future left for you and me
I was hoping and I was searching endlessly
But baby, now there's nothing left that
I can do
So don't be blue
There is another future waiting there for you
I saw it different, I must admit
I caught a glimpse, I'm going after it
They say people never change but that's bullshit, they do
Yes, I'm changing, can't stop it now
And even if I wanted, I wouldn't know how
Another version of myself I think I've found at last
And I can't always hide away
Curse indulgence and despise the fame

Every part of me says, ""Go ahead""
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
I know that you think you sound silly when you call my name

When I realise I'm just holding on to the hope that maybe
Your feelings don't show

Every part of me says, ""Go ahead""
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

740367,Tame Impala,’Cause I’m a Man,"Like the brutal morning sun
It dawns on me, what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
But it buys me a little more time
Lost in the moment for the second time
Each fuck up that I make, that makes you cry
I'm as pathetic, as the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do is ask me why
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I got for you (Uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Not often proud of what I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force I answer to
Once again, as it takes a hold
I am aware, not in control
You see, I have a conscience and it's never fooled
But it's prone to be overruled
You wanna know why I always think I’m right?
(Why?) You never accept defeat and let it slide
(Why?) I have no voice if I don’t speak my mind

No one else compared to you, no way

Whenever troubled times arose
I didn't know
Ain't always how it goes
Every single word you told me
I believed without a question, always
To save all of us, you told us both to trust
But now I know you only saved yourself
Did you think I'd never know?

Wouldn't need this for long
Never speak of the time

Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs

Mick Jagger on the phone

Won't quell the desire to know what was really going on
""Does it really fucking matter, babe?"" is all you can ask me
Okay, fair play, here we go
I've heard those words before
Are you sure it was nothing
'Cause it made me feel like dying inside
Never thought I was insecure, but it's pure
Didn't notice until I was in love for real
Am I really gonna cross the line
Just to find what you're typing?
If only I could read your mind
Ooh, I'd be fine, I'd be normal
But now’s my time, gonna do it
And suddenly I'm the phony one
The only one with a problem
True love is bringing it out of me

There must be something deep down in the dark down there
But he's not too easily scared
He's got friends but they got the fear
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh look, hey, there he is now coming down the stairs

2165806,Tame Impala,Past Life,"I was picking up a suit from the dry cleaners
Which is standard for me, Thursday, 12:30
I've got a pretty solid routine these days
I don't know, it just works for me
Anyway, I was leaving, I was getting in my car
And I went to adjust the rear-view mirror
But, in its reflection, just for a second
I saw a figure, started to trigger
Memories flooded back, stopped me in my tracks
""Who was that?"" It was my lover
A lover from a past life
From a past life
Feel like I saw a ghost
From a past life
So unexpected
From a past life
I was transfixed
From a past life
Well, somewhere between a lover and a friend
It was different back then
Surreal, poetic but uncertain
Like a bizarre chick-flick with a confusing end
But I shut it down, closed it off
The sounds and smells I made myself forget
A cheap solution to black out regret
But it was real, it just feels like a past life

But I can't seem to pass it off as just a random event
It consumes me
I thought I was moving on, but I guess I was just switching off
And now I see my life as the banal slog it instantly became
And I don't know if I can go on the same
But I don't wanna dig up old bones
I mean, I don't even know if she has the same phone number
Who knows? Maybe she does
From a past life
I guess there's no harm in trying
From a past life
What's the worst that could happen?

And it’s not like Mister Shook to get shy
When they ask him who is on top
There must be something deep down
In the dark down there
He’s not too easily scared
He’s got friends but they got the fear
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh look, hey, there he is now
Coming down the stairs
(Here he comes)
He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac
‘Cause he doesn’t like it looking
Like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact
Somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
No one remembered a thing
When they saw him again
That’s how it is 'til the end (yeah)"
